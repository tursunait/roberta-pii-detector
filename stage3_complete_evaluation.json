They don't pick the right moment. It has to FEEL right. In your heart and your intuition. Your intuition must tell you that it's okay to open up. Most guys don't even allow them to feel emotions without realising girls actually do love guys having feelings and who feel things deeply but when they're selective about who to show and share those feelings to and also when they dont dump those feelings unto people.
