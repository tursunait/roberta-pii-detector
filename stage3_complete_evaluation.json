      "text": "Why is it bad to max out my credit card every month if I pay it off in full?. Title explains it.\n\nI just applied for my first credit card and got approved for a Chase Freedom Unlimited with a $1100 limit. I've seen people recommend you only utilize around 30% of that limit, despite if you pay it in full or not. I've also seen people who use it all and pay it off in full, saying that it still hurts their credit score.\n\nWould I be able to max out the card, paying it off on time every month (I'll probably have auto-payments set up), and have any benefits? How easy would it be to get a credit increase if  I did?\n\n  \nedit: would i WANT to display a high credit utilization? If I pay off the card often, I've seen that it's also bad because it shows I dont \"use\" the card, so how often should I make payments assuming I already have the funds to pay it off whenever I want?
