He moved to my city by himself six months before I met him for a job. He was living by himself and didn\u2019t have any friends here. \n\nPrior to moving to my city, Harry had lived in a different city for 6 years working in a really good job. He had an entire life there, had bought a home there and a whole network of friends. He had moved there alone when he was in his twenties.\n\nWe truly fell completely head over heels on our first date, and from the first time meeting we didn\u2019t see anyone else. Within 6 months of dating we\u2019d gone on an overseas trip together and signed a year lease for a new apartment.\n\nFrom the beginning of our relationship, Harry had made it known to me that at some point he would like to move back to his ho",

Hello I am a guy (22m) and I always hear about how other men experience bitterness when recalling that when they \"opened-up\" to their gfs they were either dumped or it was used against them. But I've realised most of us guys don't really know what opening up really means and the proper way to do it.\n\nFirstly a lot if guys open up unnaturally when it doesn't feel right. They don't pick the right moment. It has to FEEL right. In your heart and your intuition. Your intuition must tell you that it's okay to open up. Most guys don't even allow them to feel emotions without realising girls actually do love guys having feelings and who feel things deeply but when they're selective about who to show and share those feelings to and also when they dont dump those feelings unto people. So it's important to trust your feelings. Your feelings come from the heart and your divine intuition . And it has to come naturally otherwise it looks perfo",
